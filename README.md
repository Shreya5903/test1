This project is a fully deployed, end-to-end AI-powered feedback analysis system consisting of a User Dashboard, an Admin Dashboard, and a FastAPI backend with persistent storage. Users submit their name, rating, and review through the User Dashboard, and the backend uses Gemini 2.5 Flash to generate a friendly response, a concise summary, and recommended actions. All data, including AI-generated insights, is stored in a SQLite database.

The Admin Dashboard displays a live-updating list of all reviews along with AI summaries and action recommendations, providing clear visibility into user feedback trends. The frontend is built with React and deployed on Vercel, while the backend is hosted on Railway for continuous uptime and reliability. The system supports CORS, robust error handling, and persistent data storage. This project demonstrates practical integration of LLMs in real-world feedback workflows and showcases full-stack development, API design, and deployment skills.
